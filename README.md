# swishr - AI-Powered Basketball Shooting Analysis

## Project Overview

swishr is an innovative mobile application that transforms any smartphone into a professional basketball shooting coach. Using advanced computer vision technology (YOLO V8, MediaPipe) and machine learning, it provides real-time analysis of shooting form, trajectory, and performance metrics.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Shot Analysis**: Instant feedback on shooting form and trajectory
- **Professional-Grade Metrics**: Arc angle, release point consistency, follow-through analysis
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed analytics and improvement trends over time
- **Personalized Coaching**: AI-generated recommendations based on individual weaknesses
- **Multi-Platform Support**: iOS and Android compatibility

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Computer Vision**: YOLO V8, OpenCV, MediaPipe
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Mobile**: React Native (cross-platform)
- **Cloud**: AWS/GCP with Docker containerization

### Performance Targets
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ shot outcome prediction
- **Real-time Processing**: 30+ FPS on smartphones
- **Battery Impact**: <10% drain per 30-minute session
- **Response Time**: <100ms for real-time feedback

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 16+ (for mobile development)
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swishr.git
   cd swishr
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Development Setup

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
   ```

3. **Code formatting**
   ```bash
   black src/
   flake8 src/
   ```
